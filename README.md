âš¡ Fun facts: At the height of his band's popularity, I walked through Jon Bon Jovi's high school.  I love music, so most every month or every other month, my partner and I attend "concerts" at local venues or within a 4 hour radius.  I have now seen the Eagles in concert 5 times in the past 5 years.  In one weekend, we went to two Cody Jinks concerts that 3 hours apart.
